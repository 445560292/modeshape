# Release Notes for ModeShape &version;

The ModeShape &version; release is the second stable release of our new architecture.
It's been a long journey with fourteen different alphas, betas, and candidate releases.
But this is a huge improvement over the 2.x series. We hope you enjoy it!

## What's new

&version; provides a fast, distributed, hierarchical database that clients
work with via the standard JCR 2.0 (JSR-283) API. ModeShape 3 is a major upgrade over 2.x
and offers significant improvements in performance and scalability, while retaining all of
ModeShape 2's JCR-related features. ModeShape 3 has complete integration with JBoss AS 7.1,
allowing deployed components to simply lookup and use repositories managed by ModeShape's 
service.

This release brings these improvements:

- Federated content that exists in external systems and project it into the repository as
regular content. Several connectors are provided out of the box: a file system connector 
(very similar to what was in 2.x) that accesses files and folders on the file system
and projects them as 'nt:file' and 'nt:folder' nodes; and a Git connector that accesses a local
Git repository (can be a clone of one or more remotes) and projects the branches, tags, commits
and trees within the Git repository as a node structure in the repository.
- New support for the CMIS API. This is still a 'technology preview', and we're seeking users
that can try it out and give us feedback.
- New JCA adapter to simplify deployment to application servers and containers other than
JBoss AS and EAP. (Recall that ModeShape can already be deployed as a service within AS7/EAP6).
- Separately control the size of strings and binary values that are stored in the binary store.
This repositories to always store binary values in binary storage, but only larger string values.
- Improved how repository configurations can also configure JGroups.
- Clustering bug fixes and improvements.
- Compatibility with Infinispan 5.1.2.FINAL through 5.1.8.Final. Expected to work with 
Infinispan 5.2.0.Final (when available).
- Fixes to how variables are handled in configuration files.
- Kit to install ModeShape into an existing JBoss AS7.1.1 installation now also installs
CMIS API for all repositories. Configure connectors along with all the other components.
- Improved support for very large numbers of child nodes under a single parent, including
when these nodes are projected from connectors.
- Over 50 issues (bugs, tasks, features, etc.) resolved in this release.


## Features

ModeShape &version; has changed a lot since ModeShape 2.8.x:

- ModeShape uses Infinispan for all caching and storage, giving a powerful and flexible
foundation for creating JCR repositories that are fast, scalable, and highly available.
Infinispan offers a great deal of storage options (via cache loaders), but using Infinispan 
as a distributed, mulit-site, in-memory data grid provides incredible scalability and performance.
- Improved performance. ModeShape 3 is just plain seriously fast, and performance is all-around
faster than 2.x - most operations are at least one if not several orders of magnitude faster!
We'll publish performance and benchmarking results soon.
- Improved scalability. ModeShape 3 has been designed to store and access the content so that
a node can have hundreds of thousands (or more!) of child nodes (even with same-name-siblings)
yet still be incredibly fast. Additionally, repositories can scale to many millions of nodes 
and be deployed across many processes.
- Improved configuration. There is no more global configuration of the engine; instead,
each repository is configured with a separate JSON file, which must conform to a ModeShape-specific
JSON Schema and can be validated by ModeShape prior to use. Repository configurations can even be
changed while the repository is running (some restrictions apply), making it possible to 
add/change/remove sequencers, authorization providers, and many other configuration options
while the repository is in use.
- Each repository can be deployed, started, stopped, and undeployed while the engine and other
repositories are still in use.
- Sessions immediately see all changes persisted/committed by other sessions, although
transient changes made by the session always take precedence.
- Support for participation in JTA transactions, allowing (container-managed or bean-managed)
EJBs and JCR clients that programmatically use transactions to commit the changes in the transactions.
- Monitoring API with over a dozen metrics.
- Sequencing SPI that uses the JCR API to get at the content being processed and create/update the 
derived content. Sequencers can also dynamically register namespaces and node types. Now it's easy 
to create custom sequencers.
- Connector SPI that defines how external systems are accessed and optionally updated to project
the external information into the repository as regular nodes.
- Simplified API for implementing custom MIME type detectors. ModeShape still has a built-in
Tika-based detector that determines MIME types using the filename extensions and binary content.
- New and simpler API for implementing custom text extractors, which extracts from binary values
searchable text used in full-text searches and queries.
- Improved storage of binary values of all sizes, with a separate facility for storing these on the file
system, in Infinispan caches, in relational DBMSes (via JDBC), and in MongoDB. Custom stores are also
possible.
- Public API interfaces and methods that were deprecated in 2.7.0.Final (or later) have been removed.
There weren't many of these; most of the ModeShape API remains the same as 2.x.
- Integration with JBoss AS 7. ModeShape runs as an integrated subsystem within AS7, and
the AS7 tooling can be used to define and manage repositories independently of each other
and while the server is running.
- Local and remote JDBC drivers for issuing JCR-SQL2 queries and getting database metadata via the JDBC API


All of the JCR features previously supported in 2.x are working and ready for use. 
If any issues are found, please log a bug report in our JIRA.

One feature not related to the JCR 2.0 API is enabling a repository to access the content in 
external systems (e.g., file system, SVN, JDBC, JCR, etc.). This feature was in 2.x but
has been pushed to 3.1 (roughly 6 weeks after 3.0.0.Final) so that we could release 3.0 
earlier with full support for JCR 2.0.
