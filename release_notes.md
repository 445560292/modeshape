# Release Notes for ModeShape &version;

The ModeShape &version; release is the first patch release of 3.0 and our new architecture.
This release fixes a few minor issues and one larger clustering-related issue. We hope you enjoy it!

&version; provides a fast, distributed, hierarchical database that clients
work with via the standard JCR 2.0 (JSR-283) API. ModeShape 3.0 is a major upgrade over 2.x
and offers significant improvements in performance and scalability, while retaining all of
ModeShape 2's JCR-related features. ModeShape 3.0 has complete integration with JBoss AS 7.1, 
allowing deployed components to simply lookup and use repositories managed by 
ModeShape's service.

Overall, ModeShape 3.0 has changed a lot since ModeShape 2.8.x:

- ModeShape now uses Infinispan for all caching and storage, giving a powerful and flexible
foundation for creating JCR repositories that are fast, scalable, and highly available.
Infinispan offers a great deal of storage options (via cache loaders), but using Infinispan 
as a distributed, mulit-site, in-memory data grid provides incredible scalability and performance.
- Improved performance. ModeShape 3 is just plain seriously fast, and performance is all-around
faster than 2.x - most operations are at least one if not several orders of magnitude faster!
We'll publish performance and benchmarking results soon.
- Improved scalability. ModeShape 3 has been designed to store and access the content so that
a node can have hundreds of thousands (or more!) of child nodes (even with same-name-siblings)
yet still be incredibly fast. Additionally, repositories can scale to many millions of nodes 
and be deployed across many processes.
- Improved configuration. There is no more global configuration of the engine; instead,
each repository is configured with a separate JSON file, which must conform to a ModeShape-specific
JSON Schema and can be validated by ModeShape prior to use. Repository configurations can even be
changed while the repository is running (some restrictions apply), making it possible to 
add/change/remove sequencers, authorization providers, and many other configuration options
while the repository is in use.
- Each repository can be deployed, started, stopped, and undeployed while the engine and other
repositories are still in use.
- Sessions now immediately see all changes persisted/committed by other sessions, although
transient changes made by the session always take precedence.
- Support for participation in JTA transactions, allowing (container-managed or bean-managed)
EJBs and JCR clients that programmatically use transactions to commit the changes in the transactions.
- New monitoring API with over a dozen metrics.
- New sequencing API, so sequencers now use the JCR API to get at the content being processed
and create/update the derived content. Sequencers can also dynamically register namespaces and
node types. Now it's easy to create custom sequencers.
- Simplified API for implementing custom MIME type detectors. ModeShape still has a built-in
Tika-based detector that determines MIME types using the filename extensions and binary content.
- New and simpler API for implementing custom text extractors, which extracts from binary values
searchable text used in full-text searches and queries.
- Improved storage of binary values of all sizes, with a separate facility for storing these on the file
system, in Infinispan caches, in relational DBMSes (via JDBC), and in MongoDB. Custom stores are also
possible.
- Public API interfaces and methods that were deprecated in 2.7.0.Final (or later) have been removed.
There weren't many of these; most of the ModeShape API remains the same as 2.x.
- Integration with JBoss AS 7. ModeShape runs as an integrated subsystem within AS7, and
the AS7 tooling can be used to define and manage repositories independently of each other
and while the server is running.
- Local and remote JDBC drivers for issuing JCR-SQL2 queries and getting database metadata via the JDBC API
- Many bug fixes and minor improvements

One feature not related to the JCR 2.0 API is enabling a repository to access the content in 
external systems (e.g., file system, SVN, JDBC, JCR, etc.). This feature was in 2.x but
has been pushed to 3.1 (roughly 6 weeks after 3.0.0.Final) so that we could release 3.0 
earlier with full support for JCR 2.0.
