/**
 * A repository source is a description of a resource that can be used to access or store repository information. This class
 * serves as a factory for {@link RepositoryConnection} instances and provides some basic configuration information.
 * <p>
 * Typically this interface is implemented by classes that provide standard-style getters and setters for the various properties
 * necessary for proper configuration via reflection or introspection. This interface expects nor defines any such properties,
 * leaving that entirely to the implementation classes.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Objects that implement this <code>RepositorySource</code> interface are typically registered with a naming service such as
 * Java Naming and Directory Interface<sup><font size=-3>TM</font></sup> (JNDI). This interface extends both
 * {@link Referenceable} and {@link Serializable} so that such objects can be stored in any JNDI naming context and enable proper
 * system recovery,
