/**
 * Abstract implementation of the {@link CommandExecutor} interface that provides implementations for all methods, making this a
 * useful base class for all {@link CommandExecutor} implementations. Because all methods are implemented, subclasses only need to
 * override methods that are appropriate or applicable, and all other commands will be processed correctly (even if new command
 * interfaces are added in later versions). In some cases, as with {@link CompositeCommand} and {@link GetNodeCommand}, these
 * implementations attempt to process the command. In other cases (e.g., {@link GetPropertiesCommand}, and
 * {@link DeleteBranchCommand}), the methods do nothing and should be overridden if the command is to be processed.
 * <p>
 * The implementation is also designed to be instantated as needed. This may be once per call to
 * {@link RepositoryConnection#execute(ExecutionEnvironment, GraphCommand...)}, or may be once per transaction. Either way, this
 * class is designed to allow subclasses to store additional state that may otherwise be expensive or undesirable to obtain
 * repeatedly. However, this state should be independent of the commands that are processed, meaning that implementations should
 * generally not change state as a result of processing specific commands.
 * </p>
