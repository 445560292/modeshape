     * JBoss DNA's SequencingService determines the sequencers that should be executed by monitoring the changes to one or more
     * workspaces that it is monitoring. Changes in those workspaces are aggregated and used to determine which sequencers should
     * be called. If the sequencer implements this interface, then this method is called with the property that is to be sequenced
     * along with the interface used to register the output. The framework takes care of all the rest.

     * This operation should report progress to the supplied {@link ProgressMonitor}. At the beginning of the operation, call
     * {@link ProgressMonitor#beginTask(double, org.jboss.dna.common.i18n.I18n, Object...)} with a meaningful message describing
     * the operation and a total for the amount of work that will be done by this sequencer. Then perform the sequencing work,
     * periodically reporting work by specifying the {@link ProgressMonitor#worked(double) amount of work} that has was just
     * completed or by {@link ProgressMonitor#createSubtask(double) creating a subtask} and reporting work against that subtask
     * monitor.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * The implementation should also periodically check whether the operation has been
     * {@link ProgressMonitor#isCancelled() cancelled}. If this method returns true, the implementation should abort all work as
     * soon as possible and close any resources that were acquired or opened.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * Finally, the implementation should call {@link ProgressMonitor#done()} when the operation has finished.

     * @param output the output from the sequencing operation; never null
