/**
 * A repository source is a description of a resource that can be used to access or store repository information. This class
 * serves as a factory for {@link RepositoryConnection} instances and provides some basic configuration information.
 * <p>
 * Typically this interface is implemented by classes that provide standard-style getters and setters for the various properties
 * necessary for proper configuration via reflection or introspection. This interface expects nor defines any such properties,
 * leaving that entirely to the implementation classes.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Implementations should also provide a no-arg constructor so that it is possible to easily create instances and initialize using
 * the standard getters and setters. One example where this is required is when a RepositorySource instance is recorded in a
 * repository (e.g., in a configuration area), and needs to be reinstantiated.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Objects that implement this <code>RepositorySource</code> interface are typically registered with a naming service such as Java
 * Naming and Directory Interface<sup><font size=-3>TM</font></sup> (JNDI). This interface extends both {@link Referenceable} and
 * {@link Serializable} so that such objects can be stored in any JNDI naming context and enable proper system recovery,
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * If the connections to a source are to be pooled, see {@link RepositoryConnectionPool}.
 * </p>
