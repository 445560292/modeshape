/**
 * A basic activity monitor that facilitates the updating and monitoring of progress towards the completion of an activity.
 * Documentation hereafter will refer to the code in an application that updates progress as the <strong>Updater</strong>, and
 * code that monitors progress as an <strong>Observer</strong>.
 * <p>
 * The progress of each activity is started when the <strong>Updater</strong> calls {@link #beginTask(double, I18n, Object...)},
 * continues with a mixture of work ({@link #worked(double)}) and subtasks ( {@link #createSubtask(double)}), and finishes when
 * the activity is completed ({@link #done()}) or cancelled ( {@link #setCancelled(boolean)}).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * If an activity is interrupted before its normal completion due to a cancellation request by an <strong>Observer</strong>, it is
 * still the responsibility of the <strong>Updater</strong> to mark the activity as completed. Similarly, if an activity cannot be
 * cancelled before its normal completion, the <strong>Updater</strong> must deny any previous cancellation request by calling
 * {@link #setCancelled(boolean) setCancelled(false)}.
 * </p>
