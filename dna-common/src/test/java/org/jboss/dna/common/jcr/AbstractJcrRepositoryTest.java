/**
 * An abstract base class for any unit test class that needs a JCR repository during one or more (but not necessarily all) of its
 * unit tests.
 * <p>
 * Typically, unit test classes need a repository for just some of it's unit tests (other unit tests don't need the repository
 * because they are just testing other functionality of the class under test), and this class was designed for this scenario. A
 * unit test method that needs a repository should call {@link #startRepository()}, and then may proceed to use the
 * {@link #getRepository() repository}. The test method need not call {@link #shutdownRepository()}, as it is called
 * automatically after every test (and does nothing if the repository was not started in the first place).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Some unit test methods may have a need to repeatedly start and stop the repository, and this can be done by calling
 * {@link #startRepository()} and {@link #shutdownRepository()} as many times as required.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Because the {@link TransientRepository transient repository} implementation used by this class automatically cleans itself up
 * whenever all {@link Session sessions} are closed, this class maintains an open session between the time the repository is
 * started and stopped. Therefore, unit tests can persist information in one session and see the information in other sessions.
 * </p>
