	<title>Running the example applications</title>
	<para>
    This chapter provides instructions for downloading and running a sample application that demonstrates how JBoss DNA works
    with a JCR repository to automatically sequence changing content to extract useful information. So read on to get the simple
    application running, and then in the <link linkend="using_dna">next chapter</link>
    we'll dive into the source code for the example and show how to use JBoss DNA in your own applications. </para>
	<para>JBoss DNA uses Maven 2 for its build system, as is this example. Using Maven 2 has several advantages, including
    the ability to manage dependencies. If a library is needed, Maven automatically finds and downloads that library, plus
    everything that library needs. This means that it's very easy to build the examples - or even create a maven project that
    depends on the JBoss DNA JARs.</para>
	<note>
		<para>
      To use Maven with JBoss DNA, you'll need to have <ulink url="http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index_jdk5.jsp">JDK 5 or 6</ulink>
      and Maven 2.0.7 (or higher).</para>
		<para>
      Maven can be downloaded from <ulink url="http://maven.apache.org/">http://maven.apache.org/</ulink>, and is installed by unzipping the
      <code>maven-2.0.7-bin.zip</code> file to a convenient location on your local disk. Simply add <code>$MAVEN_HOME/bin</code>
      to your path and add the following profile to your <code>~/.m2/settings.xml</code> file:</para>

		<para>There are essentially three Maven projects: a <code>sequencers</code> project, a <code>repository</code> project, 
		  and a parent project.  All of the source for the sequencing example is located in the <code>sequencers</code> subdirectory,
		  while all of the source for the federation example is located in the <code>repository</code> subdirectory.  And you may have noticed that none
      of the JBoss DNA libraries are there.  This is where Maven comes in.  The two <code>pom.xml</code> files tell
      Maven everything it needs to know about what libraries are required and how to build the example.</para>
		<para>In a terminal, go to the <code>examples</code> directory and run <emphasis role="strong"><code>mvn install</code></emphasis>.  
      This command downloads all of the JARs necessary to compile and build the example, including the JBoss DNA libraries,
      the libraries they depend on, and any missing Maven components.  (These are downloaded from the JBoss repositories
      only once and saved on your machine.  This means that the next time you run Maven, all the libraries will
      already be available locally, and the build will run much faster.)  The command then continues by compiling the example's source
      code (and unit tests) and running the unit tests.  The build is successful if you see the following:</para>

		<title>Running the sequencing example</title>
		<para>The sequencing example consists of a client application that sets up an in-memory JCR repository and that allows a user to
      upload files into that repository. The client also sets up the DNA services with two sequencers so that if any of the
      uploaded files are PNG, JPEG, GIF, BMP or other images, DNA will automatically extract the image's metadata (e.g., image
      format, physical size, pixel density, etc.) and store that in the repository.  Alternatively, if the uploaded file 
      is an MP3 audio file, DNA will extract some of the ID3 metadata (e.g., the author, title, album, year and comment)
      and store that in the repository.</para>
		<para>
      To run the client application, go to the <code>examples/sequencers/target/dna-example-sequencers-basic.dir/</code>
      directory and type <code>./run.sh</code>. You should see the command-line client and its menus in your terminal:
      <figure id="xample-sequencer-cli-client">
				<title>Example client</title>
				<graphic align="center" scale="100" fileref="example-sequencer-client.png"/>
			</figure>
      From this menu, you can upload a file into the repository, search for media in the repository, print sequencing statistics,
      or quit the application.</para>
		<para>
      The first step is to upload one of the example images. If you type 'u' and press return, you'll be prompted to supply the
      path to the file you want to upload. Since the application is running from within the
      <code>examples/sequencers/target/dna-example-sequencers-basic.dir/</code> directory, you can specify any of the files 
			in that directory without specifying the path:
      <figure id="example-sequencer-upload">
				<title>Uploading an image using the example client</title>
				<graphic align="center" scale="100" fileref="example-sequencer-upload.png"/>
			</figure>
      You can specify any fully-qualified or relative path. The application will notify you if it cannot find the file you
      specified. The example client configures JBoss DNA to sequence and MP3 audio files and image files with one of
      the following extensions (technically, nodes that have names ending in the following):
      <code>jpg</code>, <code>jpeg</code>, <code>gif</code>, <code>bmp</code>, <code>pcx</code>, <code>png</code>,
      <code>iff</code>, <code>ras</code>, <code>pbm</code>, <code>pgm</code>, <code>ppm</code>, and <code>psd</code>.
 			Files with other extensions in the repository path will be ignored. For your convenience, the example provides several
      files that will be sequenced (<code>caution.png</code>, <code>caution.jpg</code>, <code>caution.gif</code>, and
      <code>sample1.mp3</code>) and one image that will not be sequenced (<code>caution.pict</code>). Feel free to try other files.
    </para>
		<para>
      After you have specified the file you want to upload, the example application asks you where in the repository you'd like to
      place the file. (If you want to use the suggested location, just press <code>return</code>.) The client application
      uses the JCR API to upload the file to that location in the repository, creating any nodes (of type <code>nt:folder</code>)
      for any directories that don't exist, and creating a node (of type <code>nt:file</code>) for the file. And, per the JCR specification, 
			the application creates a <code>jcr:content</code> node (of type <code>nt:resource</code>) under the file node. 
			The file contents are placed on this <code>jcr:content</code> node in the <code>jcr:data</code> property. For example, if you specify
      <code>/a/b/caution.png</code>, the following structure will be created in the repository:</para>
		<programlisting><![CDATA[
/a   (nt:folder)
  /b   (nt:folder)
    /caution.png   (nt:file)
                /jcr:content    (nt:resource)
                            @jcr:data = {contents of the file}
                            @jcr:mimeType = {mime type of the file}
                            @jcr:lastModified = {now}
]]></programlisting>
    <para>Other kinds of files are treated in a similar way.</para>
		<para>When the client uploads the file using the JCR API, DNA gets notified of the changes, consults the sequencers to see whether
    	any of them are interested in the new or updated content, and if so runs those sequencers. The image sequencer processes image
    	files for metadata, and any metadata found is stored under the <code>/images</code> branch of the repository. The MP3 sequencer 
			processes MP3 audio files for metadata, and any metadata found is stored under the <code>/mp3s</code>
    	branch of the repository.  All of this happens asynchronously, so any DNA activity doesn't impede or slow down the client
    	activities.</para>
		<para>So, after the file is uploaded, you can search the repository for the image metadata using the "s" menu option:
    	<figure id="example-sequencer-search">
				<title>Searching for media using the example client</title>
				<graphic align="center" scale="100" fileref="example-sequencer-search.png"/>
			</figure>
    	Here are the search results after the <code>sample1.mp3</code> audio file has been uploaded (to the <code>/a/b/sample1.mp3</code> location):
    	<figure id="example-sequencer-search-with-mp3">
				<title>Searching for media using the example client</title>
				<graphic align="center" scale="100" fileref="example-sequencer-search-with-mp3.png"/>
			</figure>
    	You can also display the sequencing statistics using the "d" menu option:
    	<figure id="example-sequencer-statistics">
				<title>Sequencing statistics using the example client</title>
				<graphic align="center" scale="100" fileref="example-sequencer-statistics.png"/>
			</figure>
    	These stats show how many nodes were sequenced, and how many nodes were skipped because they didn't apply to the sequencer's
    	criteria.
  	</para>
		<note>
			<para>There will probably be more nodes skipped than sequenced, since there are more <code>nt:folder</code> and <code>nt:resource</code>
      	nodes than there are <code>nt:file</code> nodes with acceptable names.</para>
		</note>
		<para>You can repeat this process with other files. Any file that isn't an image or MP3 files (as recognized by the sequencing configurations
    	that we'll describe later) will not be sequenced.</para>
	</sect1>
	<sect1 id="running_repository_example">
		<title>Running the repository example</title>
		<para>The repository example consists of a client application that sets up several DNA repositories, including one that 
			is a federation of several of the others, and then allows you to navigate those repositories.</para>
		<para>
      To run the client application, go to the <code>examples/repository/target/dna-example-repository-basic.dir/</code>
      directory and type <code>./run.sh</code>. You should see the command-line client and its menus in your terminal:
      <figure id="example-repository-client">
				<title>Example Client</title>
				<graphic align="center" scale="100" fileref="example-repository-client.png"/>
			</figure>
      From this menu, you can see the list of repositories, select one, and navigate through that repository in a manner similar
      to a *nix command-line shell (although the client itself uses the JCR API to interact with the repositories).
      Here are some of the commands you can use:</para>

			<para>Try using the client to walk the different repositories.  And while this is a contrived application, it does demonstrate

	<sect1 id="downloading_and_running_review">
		<title>Summarizing what we just did</title>
		<para>In this chapter you downloaded, installed, and built the example applications.  With the sequencer client, you could upload files into a
    	JCR repository, while JBoss DNA automatically sequenced the image, MP3, or Java source files you uploaded, extracted the metadata from the
    	files, and stored that metadata inside the repository.  The repository client allowed you to walk through multiple repositories,
      including one whose content was federated from multiple other repositories.</para>
		<para>These example applications were very simplistic.  In fact, running through the examples probably only took you a few minutes.
    	So while these applications won't win any awards, they hopefully showed you the basics of what JBoss DNA can do.</para>
