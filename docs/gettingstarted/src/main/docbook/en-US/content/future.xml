		What's next for JBoss DNA?  Well, the sequencing system is just the beginning.  With this release, the sequencing system
	  is stable enough so that more <link linkend="sequencers">sequencers</link> can be developed and used within your own applications.
		We've also established the foundation for JBoss DNA repositories, including a number of <link linkend="repository-connectors">connectors</link>.
		We'll continue to expand our library of sequencers and connectors, as well as expand our support of JCR.
		Other components on our roadmap include a web user interface, a REST-ful server, and a view system that allows domain-specific
		views of information in the repository.  These components are farther out on our roadmap, and at this time have not been
		targeted to a particular release.
