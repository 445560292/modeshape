	<title>Wrapping Up</title>
	<para>
		This document provides a very high-level overview of ModeShape, introducing you to some basic concepts 
		and showing what would be required to use ModeShape in your own application.  
		We saw two simple examples that showed two different aspects of ModeShape: the sequencing system
		and the connector system.  Each of these examples showed how to create a ModeShape configuration, how to start up
		the ModeShape engine, and how to then access a <code>javax.jcr.Repository</code> instance, and after that your application
		just uses the standard JCR API.
	</para>
	<para>
		For a more in-depth description of ModeShape and the internal workings, see our &ReferenceGuide;.
		This also describes how to write your own custom sequencers or connectors.
    If you have any questions or comments, please feel free to contact ModeShape's
    <ulink url="mailto:modeshape-users@lists.jboss.org">user mailing list</ulink>, use our
    <ulink url="http://community.jboss.org/community/modeshape">discussion forums</ulink>,
    or chat with the developers in the <ulink url="http://www.jboss.org/modeshape/chat.html">IRC chat room</ulink>.
    If you find a bug or have a suggestion, please let us know or (better yet) create a new issue in the project's
    <ulink url="&JIRA;">JIRA issue management system</ulink>
    . If there's something in particular you're interested in, talk with the community - there may be others interested in the
    same thing.

		<title>Future directions</title>
		<para>
			At this point, ModeShape passes all of the JCR Technology Compatibility Kit (TCK) tests 
			for Level 1, Level 2, and the optional locking and versioning features (plus almost all of the tests for the
			optional observation feature). We'll soon begin the process of attaining JCR certification for ModeShape.
		</para>
		<para>
			We also plan to add support for clustering multiple ModeShape engines spread across multiple JVM processes.
			And each expect to introduce more 
			<link linkend="repository-connectors">connectors</link> and <link linkend="sequencers">sequencers</link> to our library.
			Other items on our long-term roadmap include a web user interface, Seam integration, and integration with even more kinds of
			information systems and repositories.
