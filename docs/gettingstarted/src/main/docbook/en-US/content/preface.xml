  <title>What this book covers</title>
  <para>The goal of this book is to help you learn about JBoss DNA and how you can use it in your own applications to get the
    most out of your JCR repositories.</para>
  <para>The first part of the book starts out with an introduction to content repositories and an overview of the JCR API,
    both of which are important aspects of JBoss DNA. This is followed by an overview of the JBoss DNA project, its
    architecture, and a basic roadmap for what's coming next.</para>
  <para>The next part of the book covers how to download and build the examples, how to use JBoss DNA with existing
    repositories, and how to build and use custom sequencers.</para>
