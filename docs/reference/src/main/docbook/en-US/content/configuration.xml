		Configuring JBoss DNA services is a bit more manual than is ideal. JBoss DNA currently consists of classes that uses dependency
    injection to allow a great deal of flexibility in how it can be configured and customized. But this flexibility
    makes it more difficult for you to configure.  We understand this, and will soon provide a much easier way to set up 
		and manage JBoss DNA.  Current plans are to use the <ulink url="http://www.jboss.org/jbossmc">JBoss Microcontainer</ulink>
		along with a configuration repository.
