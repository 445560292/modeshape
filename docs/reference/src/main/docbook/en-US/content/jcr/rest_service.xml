  <title>The ModeShape RESTful Web Service</title>
  <para>
		ModeShape now provides a RESTful interface to its JCR implementation that allows HTTP-based 
		access and updating of content.  Although the initial version of this REST server only supports the ModeShape
		JCR implementation, it has been designed to make integration with other JCR implementors easy.  This
		chapter describes how to configure and deploy the REST server. 
  </para>
	<sect1 id="supported_rest_resources">
		<title>Supported Resources and Methods</title>
		<para>
			The REST Server currently supports the URIs and HTTP methods described below.  The URI patterns assume
			that the REST server is deployed at its conventional location of "/resources".  These URI patterns would
			change if the REST server were deployed under a different web context and URI patterns below would
			change accordingly.  Currently, only JSON-encoded responses are provided.

		<para>
		Note that this approach supports dynamic discovery of the available repositories on the server.  A typical
		conversation might start with a request to the server to check the available repositories.
<programlisting>
GET http://www.example.com/resources
</programlisting>		 
		This request would generate a response that mapped the names of the available repositories to metadata information
		about the repositories like so:
<programlisting><![CDATA[
{
	"modeshape%3arepository" : { 
		"repository" : {
			"name" : "modeshape%3arepository",
			"resources" : { "workspaces":"/resources/modeshape%3arepository" }
		}
	}
}
]]></programlisting>		 
		The actual response wouldn't be pretty-printed like the example, but the format would be the same.  The name
		of the repository ("mode:repository" URL-encoded) is mapped to a repository object that contains a name
		(the redundant "mode:repository") and a list of available resources within the repository and their respective
		URIs.  Note that ModeShape supports deploying multiple JCR repositories side-by-side on the same server,
		so this response could easily contain multiple repositories in a real deployment.  
	</para>
	<para>		
		The only thing that you can do with a repository through the REST interface at this time is to
		get a list of its workspaces.  A request to do so can be built up from the previous response like this:
<programlisting>
GET http://www.example.com/resources/modeshape%3arepository
</programlisting>		 
		This request (and all of the following requests) actually create a JCR &Session; to service the request and
		require that security be configured.  This process is described in more detail in 
		<link linkend="modeshape_rest_server_configuration">a later section</link>.  Assuming that security has been properly
		configured, the response would look something like this:
<programlisting><![CDATA[
{
	"default" : {
		"workspace" : {
			"name" : "default",
			"resources" : { "items":"/resources/modeshape%3arepository/default/items" }
		}
	}
}
]]></programlisting>	
		Like the first response, this response consists of a list of workspace names mapped to metadata about the
		workspaces.  The example above only lists one workspace for simplicity, but there could be many different
		workspaces returned in a real deployment.  Note that the "items" resource builds the full URI to the root
		of the items hierarchy, including the encoding of the repository name and the workspace name.
		</para>
		<para>
		Now a request can be built to retrieve the root item of the repository.
<programlisting>
GET http://www.example.com/resources/modeshape%3arepository/default/items
</programlisting>		 
		Any other item in the repository could be accessed by appending its path to the URI above.  In a default
		repository with no content, this would return the following response:  
<programlisting><![CDATA[
{
	"properties": {
		"jcr:primaryType": "mode:root",
		"jcr:uuid": "97d7e2ef-996e-4d99-8ec2-dc623e6c2239"
	},
	"children": ["jcr:system"]
]]></programlisting>		 
	    The response contains a mapping of property names to their values and an array of child names.  Had one of
	    the properties been multi-valued, the values for that property would have been provided as an array as well, 
	    as will shortly be shown.
	    </para>
	    <para>
	    The items resource also contains an option query parameter: <code>mode:depth</code>.  This parameter, which defaults
	    to 1, controls how deep the hierarchy of returned nodes should be.  Had the request had the parameter:
<programlisting>
GET http://www.example.com/resources/modeshape%3arepository/default/items?mode:depth=2
</programlisting>		 
	    Then the response would have contained details for the children of the root node as well.
<programlisting><![CDATA[
{
	"properties": {
		"jcr:primaryType": "mode:root",
		"jcr:uuid": "163bc5e5-3b57-4e63-b2ae-ededf43d3445"
	},
	"children": {
		"jcr:system": {
			"properties": {"jcr:primaryType": "mode:system"},
    		"children": ["mode:namespaces"]
		}
	}
}
]]></programlisting>		 
		</para>
		<para>
		It is also possible to use the RESTful API to add, modify and remove repository content.  Removes are simple -
		a DELETE request with no body returns a response with no body.
<programlisting>
DELETE http://www.example.com/resources/modeshape%3arepository/default/items/path/to/deletedNode
</programlisting>		 
		</para>
		<para>
		Adding content simply requires a POST to the name of the <emphasis>relative</emphasis> root node of the
		content that you wish to add and a request body in the same format as the response from a GET.  Adding multiple
		nodes at once is supported, as shown below.
<programlisting><![CDATA[
POST http://www.example.com/resources/modeshape%3arepository/default/items/newNode

{
	"properties": {
		"jcr:primaryType": "nt:unstructured",
		"jcr:mixinTypes": "mix:referenceable",
		"someProperty": "foo"
	},
	"children": {
		"newChildNode": {
			"properties": {"jcr:primaryType": "nt:unstructured"}
		}
	}
}
]]></programlisting>		 
		Note that protected properties like jcr:uuid are not provided but that the primary type and mixin types are
		provided as properties.  The REST server will translate these into the appropriate calls behind the
		scenes.  The response from the request will be empty by convention.
		</para>
		<para>
		The PUT method allows for updates of nodes and properties.  If the URI points to a property, the body of the
		request should be the new JSON-encoded value for the property, which includes the property name (allowing
		proper determination of whether the values are binary; see the 
		<link linkend="binary_properties_in_rest_representations">next section"</link>").
<programlisting><![CDATA[
PUT http://www.example.com/resources/modeshape%3arepository/default/items/newNode/someProperty

{
	"someProperty" : "bar"
}
]]></programlisting>
		Setting multiple properties at once can be performed by providing a URI to a node instead of a property. The
		body of the request should then be a JSON object that maps property names to their new values.
<programlisting><![CDATA[
PUT http://www.example.com/resources/modeshape%3arepository/default/items/newNode

{
	"someProperty": "foobar",
	"someOtherProperty": "newValue"
}
]]></programlisting>
		<note>
			<para>
			The PUT method doesn't currently support adding or removing mixin types.  This will be corrected in the future.
			A <ulink url="https://jira.jboss.org/jira/browse/ModeShape-447">JIRA issue</ulink> has been created to help 
			track this issue.
			</para>
		</note>
		</para>
		<sect2 id="binary_properties_in_rest_representations">
			<title>Binary properties</title>
			<para>
		    Binary property values are included in any of the the responses or requests, but are represented 
		    string values containing the <ulink url="&Wikipedia;Base64">Base 64 encoding</ulink> of the binary content.  
		    Any such property is explicitly annotated such that "/base64/" is appended to the property name.  
		    First of all, this makes it very clear to the client and service which properties are encoded, allowing them 
		    to properly decode the values before use.  Secondly, the "/base64/" suffix was carefully chosen because it 
		    cannot be used in a real property name (without escaping).  Here's an example of a node containing a "jcr:primaryType" 
		    property with a single string value, a "jcr:uuid" property with another single UUID value, another 
		    "options" property that has two integer values, and a fourth "content" property that has a single
		    binary value:
<programlisting><![CDATA[
{
	"properties": {
		"jcr:primaryType": "nt:unstructured",
		"jcr:uuid": "163bc5e5-3b57-4e63-b2ae-ededf43d3445"
		"options": [ "1", "2" ]
		"content/base64/": 
	"TWFuIGlzIGRpc3Rpbmd1aXNoZWQsIG5vdCBvbmx5IGJ5IGhpcyByZWFzb24sIGJ1dCBieSB0aGlz

	},
}
]]></programlisting>
	      All values of a property will always be Base 64 encoded if at least one of the values is binary.
	      If there are multiple values, then they will be separated by commas and will appear within '[' and ']' 
	      characters (just like other properties).

        <para>
            The ModeShape REST Client API provides a POJO way of using the ModeShape REST web service to publish (upload) and 
            unpublish (delete) files from ModeShape repositories. Java objects open the HTTP connection, create the HTTP request URLs, 
            attach the payload associated with <code>PUT</code> and <code>POST</code> requests, parse the HTTP JSON response back 
            into Java objects, and close the HTTP connection.
        </para>
        <para>
            Here are the Java business objects you will need (all found in the <code>org.modeshape.web.jcr.rest.client.domain</code> 
            package):

            <itemizedlist>
                <listitem>
                    <para><code>Server</code> - hosts one or more ModeShape JCR repositories,</para>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    <para><code>Repository</code> - a ModeShape JCR repository containing one or more workspaces, and</para>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    <para><code>Workspace</code> - a ModeShape JCR repository workspace.</para>
                </listitem>
            </itemizedlist>
        </para>
        <para>
            Along with the POJOs above, an <code>org.modeshape.web.jcr.rest.client.IRestClient</code> is needed. The 
            <code>IRestClient</code> is responsible for executing the publishing and unpublishing operations. You can also use the
            <code>IRestClient</code> to find out what repositories and workspaces are available on a ModeShape server.

            <note>
                <para>
                    The only implementation of <code>IRestClient</code> is <code>JsonRestClient</code> as JSON-encoded responses are 
                    all that are currently available.
                </para>
            </note>
                
            Here's a code snippet that publishes (uploads) a file:

            <programlisting><![CDATA[
// Setup POJOs
Server server = new Server("http://localhost:8080", "username", "password");
Repository repository = new Repository("repositoryName", server);
Workspace workspace = new Workspace("workspaceName", repository);

// Publish
File file = new File("/path/to/file");
IRestClient restClient = new JsonRestClient();
Status status = restClient.publish(workspace, "/workspace/path/", file);

if (status.isError() {
    // Handle error here
}
            ]]></programlisting>
        </para>
        <para>
            Successfully executing the above code results in the creation a JCR folder node (<code>nt:folder</code>) for each segment of the 
            workspace path (if the folder didn't already exist). Also, a JCR file node (a node with primary type <code>nt:file</code>) is 
            created or updated under the last folder node and the file contents are encoded and uploaded into a child node of that file node.
