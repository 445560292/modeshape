  <title>Graph API</title>
  <para>
		One of the central concepts within JBoss DNA is that of its <emphasis>graph model</emphasis>.
		Information is structured into a hierarchy of nodes with properties, where nodes in the hierarchy
		are identified by their path (and/or identifier properties).  Properties are identified by
		a name that incorporates a namespace and local name, and contain one or more property values
		consisting of normal Java strings, names, paths, URIs, booleans, longs, doubles, decimals, binary content,
		dates, UUIDs, references to other nodes, or any other serializable object.
	</para>
	<para>
		This graph model is used throughout JBoss DNA: it forms the basis for the 
		<link linkend="connector_framework">connector framework</link>, it is used by the 
		<link linkend="sequencing_framework">sequencing framework</link> for the generated output,
		and it is what the <link linkend="jcr">JCR implementation</link> uses internally to access and operate
		on the repository content.
	</para>
	<para>
		Therefore, this chapter provides essential information that will be essential to really understanding
		how the connectors, sequencers, and other JBoss DNA features work.
	</para>
	<sect1 id="graph-names">
		<title>Names</title>
		<para>
			JBoss DNA uses names to identify quite a few different types of objects.  As we'll soon see, each property
			of a node is given by a name, and each segment in a path is comprised of a name.  Therefore,
			names are a very important concept.
		</para>
		<para>
			JBoss DNA names consist of a local part and are qualified with a namespaces.  The local part can consist of
			any character, and the namespace is identified by a URI.  Namespaces were introduced in the
			<link linkend="execution-context">previous chapter</link> and are managed by the &ExecutionContext;'s
			<link linkend="namespace-registry">namespace registry</link>.  Namespaces help reduce the risk of
			clashes in names that have an equivalent same local part.
		</para>
		<para>
			All names are immutable, which means that once a &Name; object is created, it will never change.
			This characteristic makes it much easier to write thread-safe code - the objects never change and therefore
			require no locks or synchronization to guarantee atomic reads.  This is a technique that is more and more
			often found in newer languages and frameworks that simplify concurrent operations.
		</para>
		<para>
			&Name; is also a interface rather than a concrete class:
		</para>
<programlisting>
@Immutable
public interface &Name; extends Comparable&lt;&Name;>, &Serializable;, &Readable; {

    /**
     * Get the local name part of this qualified name.
     * @return the local name; never null
     */
    String getLocalName();

    /**
     * Get the URI for the namespace used in this qualified name.
     * @return the URI; never null but possibly empty
     */
    String getNamespaceUri();
}</programlisting>
		<para>
			This means that you need to use a factory to create &Name; instances.
		</para>
		<para>
			The use of a factory may seem like a disadvantage and unnecessary complexity, but there actually
			are several benefits.  First, it hides the concrete implementations, which is very appealing if
			an optimized implementation can be chosen for particular situations.  It also simplifies the
			usage, since &Name; only has a few methods.  Third, it allows the factory to cache or pool instances
			where appropriate to help conserve memory.  Finally, the very same factory actually serves as
			a <emphasis>conversion</emphasis> mechanism from other forms.  We'll actually see more of this
			later in this chapter, when we talk about other kinds of <link linkend="graph-properties">property values</link>.
		</para>
		<para>
			The factory for creating &Name; objects is called &NameFactory; and is available within the &ExecutionContext;, 
			via the <code>getValueFactories()</code> method.  But before we see that, let's first discuss how names are represented as strings.
		</para>
		<para>
			We'll see how names are used later one, but one more point to make:  &Name; is both serializable and comparable,
			and all implementations should support <code>equals(...)</code> and <code>hashCode()</code> so that &Name; can
			be used as a key in a hash-based map.  &Name; also extends the &Readable; interface, which we'll learn
			more about later in this chapter.
		</para>
	</sect1>
	<sect1 id="graph-paths">
		<title>Paths</title>
		<para>
			Another important concept in JBoss DNA's graph model is that of a <emphasis>path</emphasis>, which provides a way
			of locating a node within a hierarchy.  JBoss DNA's &Path; object is an immutable ordered sequence
			of &PathSegment; objects.  A small portion of the interface is shown here:
		</para>
		<programlisting>

    public &Path; subpath( int beginIndex, int endIndex );

    ...
}   </programlisting>
		<para>
			There are actually quite a few methods (not shown above) for obtaining related paths: the path of the parent, the path of an ancestor,
			resolving a path relative to this path, normalizing a path (by removing "." and ".." segments), finding the lowest
			common ancestor shared with another path, etc. There are also a number of methods that compare the path with others,
			including determining whether a path is above, equal to, or below this path.
		</para>
		<para>
			Each &PathSegment; is an immutable pair of a &Name; and <emphasis>same-name-sibling (SNS) index</emphasis>.  When two sibling nodes
			have the same name, then the first sibling will have SNS index of "1" and the second will be given a SNS index of "2".
			(This mirrors the same-name-sibling index behavior of <ulink url="&JSR170;">JCR paths</ulink>.)

	<sect1 id="graph-properties">
		<title>Properties</title>
		<para>
			The JBoss DNA graph model allows nodes to hold multiple properties, where each property is identified
			by a unique &Name; and may have one or more values.  Like many of the other classes used in the graph model,
			&Property; is an immutable object that, once constructed, can never be changed and therefore provides
			a consistent snapshot of the state of a property as it existed at the time it was read.
		</para>
		<para>
		  JBoss DNA properties can hold a wide range of value objects, including normal Java strings, names, paths, 
		  URIs, booleans, longs, doubles, decimals, binary content,	dates, UUIDs, references to other nodes, 
		  or any other serializable object.  All but three these are the standard Java classes: dates are
		  represented by an immutable &DateTime; class; binary content is represented by an immutable &Binary;
		  interface patterned after the proposed interface of the same name in <ulink url="&JSR283;">JSR-283</ulink>;
		  and &Reference; is an immutable interface patterned after the corresponding interface is 
		  <ulink url="&JSR170;">JSR-170</ulink> and <ulink url="&JSR283;">JSR-283</ulink>.

		<para>
			Creating &Property; instances is done by using the &PropertyFactory; object owned by the &ExecutionContext;.
			This factory defines methods for creating properties with a &Name; and various representation of values,
			including variable-length arguments, arrays, &Iterator;, and &Iterable;.
		</para>
		<para>
			When it comes to using the property values, JBoss DNA takes a non-traditional approach.
			Many other graph models (including JCR) mark each property with a data type and then require 
			all property values adhere to this data type. When the property values are obtained, they
			are guaranteed to be of the correct type. However, many times the property's data type may
			not match the data type expected by the caller, and so a conversion may be required
			and thus has to be coded.
		</para>
		<para>
			The JBoss DNA graph model uses a different tact.  Because callers almost always have to convert the
			values to the types they can handle, JBoss DNA skips the steps of associating the  &Property; with a data type
			and ensuring the values match.  Instead, JBoss DNA simply provides a very easy mechanism to convert
			the property values to the type desired by the caller.  In fact, the conversion mechanism
			is exactly the same as the factories that create the values in the first place.

			JBoss DNA properties can hold a variety of types of value objects: strings, names, paths,

		<para>
			This makes it very easy to convert one or more values (of any type, including mixtures) into
			corresponding value(s) that are of the desired type.  For example, converting the first value
			of a property (regardless of type) to a String is simple:
		</para>
		<programlisting>
&ValueFactory;&lt;String> stringFactory = ...
&Property; property = ...
String value = stringFactory.create( property.getFirstValue() );
		</programlisting>
		<para>
			Likewise, iterating over the values in a property and converting them is just as easy:
		</para>
		<programlisting>
&ValueFactory;&lt;String> stringFactory = ...
&Property; property = ...
for ( String value : stringFactory.create(property) ) {
    // do something with the values
}
		</programlisting>
		<para>
			What we've glossed over so far, however, is how to obtain the correct &ValueFactory; for the desired type.
			If you remember back to the previous chapter, &ExecutionContext; has a <code>getValueFactories()</code> method
			that return a &ValueFactories; interface:
		</para>
		<programlisting>
		</programlisting>
		<para>
			This interface exposes a &ValueFactory; for each of the types, and even has methods to obtain a &ValueFactory;
			given the &PropertyType; enumeration.  So, the previous examples could be expanded a bit:
		</para>
		<programlisting>
&ValueFactory;&lt;String> stringFactory = context.getValueFactories().getStringFactory();
&Property; property = ...
String value = stringFactory.create( property.getFirstValue() );
		</programlisting>

for ( String value : stringFactory.create(property) ) {
    // do something with the values
}
		</programlisting>
		<para>
			You might have noticed that several of the &ValueFactories; methods return subinterfaces of &ValueFactory;.  These
			add type-specific methods that are more commonly needed in certain cases.  For example, here is the &NameFactory; interface:
		</para>

		<para>and here is the &DateTimeFactory; interface, which adds methods for creating &DateTime; values for the current
			time as well as for specific instants in time:</para>
		<programlisting>

		<para>
			The &PathFactory; interface defines methods for creating relative and absolute &Path; objects using combinations of other &Path; objects

		<para>
			We've seen the &NamespaceRegistry; in the <link linkend="execution-context">previous chapter</link>,
			but we've haven't yet talked about the &TextEncoder; interface.  A &TextEncoder; merely does what
			you'd expect: it encodes the characters in a string using some implementation-specific algorithm.  
			JBoss DNA provides a number of &TextEncoder; implementations, including:
			<itemizedlist>
				<listitem>
					<para>The &Jsr283Encoder; escapes characters that are not allowed in JCR names, 
						per the <ulink url="&JSR283;">JSR-283</ulink> specification.  Specifically,
						these are the '*', '/', ':', '[', ']', and '|' characters, which are escaped by replacing
						them with the Unicode characters U+F02A, U+F02F, U+F03A, U+F05B, U+F05D, and U+F07C, respectively.
					</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>The &NoOpEncoder; does no conversion.
					</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>The &UrlEncoder; converts text to be used within the different parts of a URL, as defined by Section 2.3 of
						<ulink url="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2396.txt">RFC 2396</ulink>. Note that this class does not 
						encode a complete URL (since <code>java.net.URLEncoder</code> and <code>java.net.URLDecoder</code>
						should be used for such purposes).
					</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>The &XmlNameEncoder; converts any UTF-16 unicode character that is not a valid XML name character according to the 
						<ulink url="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml/#sec-common-syn">World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Extensible Markup Language (XML) 1.0
						(Fourth Edition) Recommendation</ulink>, escaping such characters as <code>_xHHHH_</code>, where <code>HHHH</code> stands for the 
						four-digit hexadecimal UTF-16 unicode value for the character in the most significant bit first order. 
						For example, the name "Customer_ID" is encoded as "Customer_x0020_ID".
					</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>The &XmlValueEncoder; escapes characters that are not allowed in XML values.  Specifically,
						these are the '&amp;', '&lt;', '&gt;', '&quot;', and '&#039;', which are all escaped to
						"&amp;amp;", '&amp;lt;', '&amp;gt;', '&amp;quot;', and '&amp;#039;'.
					</para>
				</listitem>
			</itemizedlist>
			All of these classes also implement the &TextDecoder; interface, which defines a method that
			<emphasis>decodes</emphasis> an encoded string using the opposite transformation.
		</para>
		<para>
			Of course, you can provide alternative implementations, and supply them to the appropriate <code>getString(...)</code> methods
			as required.
		</para>
	</sect1>
	<sect1 id="graph-location">
		<title>Locations</title>
		<para>
			In addition to &Path; objects, nodes can be identified by one or more <emphasis>identification properties</emphasis>.
			These really are just &Property; instances with names that have a special meaning 
			(usually to <link linkend="connector-framework">connectors</link>).
			JBoss DNA also defines a &Location; class that encapsulates:
		  <itemizedlist>
		    <listitem>
		      <para>the &Path; to the node; or</para>
		    </listitem>
		    <listitem>
		      <para>one or more <emphasis>identification properties</emphasis> that are likely source=specific
						and that are represented with &Property; objects; or</para>
		    </listitem>
		    <listitem>
		      <para>a combination of both.</para>
		    </listitem>
		  </itemizedlist>
			So, when a client knows the path and/or the identification properties, they can create a &Location; object
			and then use that to identify the node.  &Location; is a class that can be instantiated through factory 
			methods on the class:
		</para>
		<programlisting>
public abstract class &Location; implements &Iterable;&lt;&Property;>, Comparable&lt;&Location;> {

    public static &Location; create( &Path; path ) { ... }
    public static &Location; create( &UUID; uuid ) { ... }
    public static &Location; create( &Path; path, &UUID; uuid ) { ... }
    public static &Location; create( &Path; path, &Property; idProperty ) { ... }
    public static &Location; create( &Path; path, &Property; firstIdProperty, 
                                     &Property;... remainingIdProperties ) { ... }
    public static &Location; create( &Path; path, &Iterable;&lt;&Property; idProperties ) { ... }
    public static &Location; create( &Property; idProperty ) { ... }
    public static &Location; create( &Property; firstIdProperty, 
                                     &Property;... remainingIdProperties ) { ... }
    public static &Location; create( &Iterable;&lt;&Property;> idProperties ) { ... }
    public static &Location; create( &List;&lt;&Property;> idProperties ) { ... }
    ...
}		</programlisting>
		<para>
		  Like many of the other classes and interfaces, &Location; is immutable and cannot be changed once created.
		  However, there are methods on the class to create a copy of the &Location; object with a different &Path;,
		  a different &UUID;, or different identification properties:
		</para>
		<programlisting>
public abstract class &Location; implements &Iterable;&lt;&Property;>, Comparable&lt;&Location;> {
    ...
    public &Location; with( &Property; newIdProperty );
    public &Location; with( &Path; newPath );
    public &Location; with( &UUID; uuid );
    ...
}		</programlisting>
		<para>
			One more thing about locations: we'll see later in the next chapter how they are used to make requests
			to the <link linkend="connector-framework">connectors</link>.  When creating the requests, clients usually have an 
			incomplete location (e.g., a path but no identification properties).  When processing the requests, connectors
			provide an <emphasis>actual</emphasis> location that contains the path <emphasis>and</emphasis> all identification properties.
			If actual &Location; objects are then reused in subsequent requests by the client, the connectors will have the benefit of having
			both the path and identification properties and may be able to more efficiently locate the identified node.
		</para>

	<sect1 id="graph-api">
		<title>Graph API</title>
		<para>
			JBoss DNA's <emphasis>Graph API</emphasis> was designed as a lightweight public API for working with graph information.
			The &Graph; class is the primary class in API, and each instance represents a single, independent
			view of a single graph.  &Graph; instances don't maintain state, so every request (or batch of requests) operate against
			the underlying graph and the return <emphasis>immutable snapshots</emphasis> of the requested state at the time
			the request was made.
		</para>
		<para>
			There are several ways to obtain a &Graph; instance, as we'll see in later chapters.  For the time being, the important
			thing to understand is what a &Graph; instance represents and how it interacts with the underlying content to return
			representations of portions of that underlying graph content.
		</para>
		<para>
			The &Graph; class basically represents an <ulink url="http://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/DomainSpecificLanguage.html">internal domain specific language (DSL)</ulink>,
			designed to be easy to use in an application.  
			The Graph API makes extensive use of interfaces and method chaining, so that methods return a concise interface that has only those
			methods that make sense at that point.  In fact, this should be really easy if your IDE has code completion.
			Just remember that under the covers, a &Graph; is just building &Request; objects, submitting them to the connector,
			and then exposing the results.
		</para>
		<para>
			The next few subsections describe how to use a &Graph; instance.
		</para>
		<sect2 id="graph-api-workspaces">
			<title>Using workspaces</title>
		<para>
			JBoss DNA graphs have the notion of <emphasis>workspaces</emphasis> that provide different views of the content.  Some graphs may have
			one workspace, while others may have multiple workspaces.  Some graphs will allow a client to create new workspaces or destroy
			existing workspaces, while other graphs will not allow adding or removing workspaces.  Some graphs may have workspaces may show the same (or very
			similar) content, while other graphs may have workspaces that each contain completely independent content.
		</para>
		<para>
			The &Graph; object is always bound to a workspace, which initially is the <emphasis>default workspace</emphasis>.  To find out
			what the name of the default workspace is, simply ask for the current workspace after creating the &Graph;:
		</para>
		<programlisting>
&Workspace; current = graph.getCurrentWorkspace();
</programlisting>
		<para>
			To obtain the list of workspaces available in a graph, simply ask for them:
		</para>
		<programlisting>
&Set;&lt;&String;> workspaceNames = graph.getWorkspaces();
</programlisting>
		<para>Once you know the name of a particular workspace, you can specify that the graph should use it:
		</para>
		<programlisting>
graph.useWorkspace("myWorkspace");
</programlisting>
		<para>
			From this point forward, all requests will apply to the workspace named "myWorkspace".  At any time, you can use a different workspace,
			which will affect all subsequent requests made using the graph.  To go back to the default workspace, simply supply a null name:
		</para>
		<programlisting>
graph.useWorkspace(null);
</programlisting>
		<para>
			Of course, creating a new workspace is just as easy:
		</para>
		<programlisting>
graph.createWorkspace().named("newWorkspace");
</programlisting>
	  <para>This will attempt to create a workspace named "newWorkspace", which will fail if that workspace already exists.  You may
		want to create a new workspace with a name that should be altered if the name you supply is already used.  The following code shows
		how you can do this:
		</para>
		<programlisting>
graph.createWorkspace().namedSomethingLike("newWorkspace");
</programlisting>
	  <para>If there is no existing workspace named "newWorkspace", a new one will be created with this name.  However, if "newWorkspace" already
		exists, this call will create a workspace with a name that is some alteration of the supplied name.
		</para>
	  <para>
		You can also clone workspaces, too:
		</para>
		<programlisting>
graph.createWorkspace().clonedFrom("original").named("something");
</programlisting>
		<para>
			or
		</para>
		<programlisting>
graph.createWorkspace().clonedFrom("original").namedSomethingLike("something");
</programlisting>
		<para>
			As you can see, it's very easy to specify which workspace you want to use or to create new workspaces.  You can also find out which workspace
			the graph is currently using:
		</para>
		<programlisting>
&String; current = graph.getCurrentWorkspaceName();
</programlisting>
		<para>or, if you want, you can get more information about the workspace:
		</para>
		<programlisting>
&Workspace; current = graph.getCurrentWorkspace();
&String; name = current.getName();
&Location; rootLocation = current.getRoot();
</programlisting>
    </sect2>
		<sect2 id="graph_api_nodes">
			<title>Working with nodes</title>
		<para>
			Now let's switch to working with nodes.  This first example returns a map of properties (keyed by property name) 
			for a node at a specific &Path;:
		</para>
		<programlisting>
&Path; path = ...
Map&lt;&Name;,&Property;> propertiesByName = graph.getPropertiesByName().on(path);
</programlisting>
		<para>
			This next example shows how the graph can be used to obtain and loop over the properties of a node:
		</para>
		<programlisting>
&Path; path = ...
for ( &Property; property : graph.getProperties().on(path) ) {
	  ...
}
</programlisting>
		<para>
			Likewise, the next example shows how the graph can be used to obtain and loop over the children of a node:
		</para>
		<programlisting>
&Path; path = ...
for ( &Location; child : graph.getChildren().of(path) ) {
    &Path; childPath = child.getPath();
	  ...
}
</programlisting>
		<para>
			Notice that the examples pass a &Path; instance to the <code>on(...)</code> and <code>of(...)</code> methods.  Many
			of the Graph API methods take a variety of parameter types, including String, &Path;s, &Location;s, &UUID;, or &Property; parameters.
			This should make it easy to use in many different situations.
		</para>
		<para>
			Of course, changing content is more interesting and offers more interesting possibilities.  Here are a few examples:
		</para>
		<programlisting>
&Path; path = ...
&Location; location = ...
&Property; idProp1 = ...
&Property; idProp2 = ...
&UUID; uuid = ...
graph.move(path).into(idProp1, idProp2);
graph.copy(path).into(location);
graph.delete(uuid);
graph.delete(idProp1,idProp2);
</programlisting>
		<para>
			The methods shown above work immediately, as soon as each request is built.  However, there is another way to use
			the &Graph; object, and that is in a <emphasis>batch</emphasis> mode.  Simply create a &GraphBatch; object using the
			<code>batch()</code> method, create the requests on that batch object, and then execute all of the commands on the
			batch by calling its <code>execute()</code> method.  That <code>execute()</code> method returns a &Results; interface
			that can be used to read the node information retrieved by the batched requests. 
		</para>
		<para>
			Method chaining works really well with the batch mode, since multiple commands can be assembled together very easily:
		</para>
		<programlisting>
&Path; path = ...
String path2 = ...
&Location; location = ...
&Property; idProp1 = ...
&Property; idProp2 = ...
&UUID; uuid = ...
graph.batch().move(path).into(idProp1, idProp2)
       .and().copy(path2).into(location)
       .and().delete(uuid)
       .execute();
&Results; results = graph.batch().read(path2)
                           .and().readChildren().of(idProp1,idProp2)
                           .and().readSugraphOfDepth(3).at(uuid2)
                           .execute();
for ( &Location; child : results.getNode(path2) ) {
    ...
}
</programlisting>
		<para>
			Of course, this section provided just a hint of the Graph API.  
			The &Graph; interface is actually quite complete and offers a full-featured approach for reading and updating a graph.
			For more information, see the &Graph; JavaDocs.

			In this chapter, we introduced JBoss DNA's <emphasis>graph model</emphasis> and showed the different

			used to read, update, and change content.
		</para>
		<para>
			Next, we'll dive into the <link linkend="connector_framework">connector framework</link>, which builds
			on top of the graph model and request model, allowing JBoss DNA to access the graph content stored
