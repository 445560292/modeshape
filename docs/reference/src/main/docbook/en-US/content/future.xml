	<para>
		ModeShape &versionNumber; provides a very capable JCR implementation with powerful and unique features not matched
		by other implementations.  This release moves ModeShape to the JCR 2.0 API, implements several new features, 
		and includes fixes and improvements. 
	</para>
	<para>ModeShape now implements all of the required JCR 2.0 features:
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem><para>repository acquisition</para></listitem>
      <listitem><para>authentication</para></listitem>
      <listitem><para>reading/navigating</para></listitem>

      <listitem><para>node type discovery</para></listitem>
      <listitem><para>permissions and capability checking</para></listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
		and implements most of the optional JCR 2.0 features:
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem><para>writing</para></listitem>
      <listitem><para>import</para></listitem>
      <listitem><para>observation</para></listitem>

      <listitem><para>same-name siblings</para></listitem>
      <listitem><para>orderable child nodes</para></listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    ModeShape supports the JCR-SQL2 and JQOM query languages defined in <ulink url="&JSR283;">JSR-283</ulink>, 
    plus the XPath and JCR-SQL languages defined in <ulink url="&JSR170;">JSR-170</ulink> but deprecated in
    <ulink url="&JSR283;">JSR-283</ulink>.
	</para>
	<para>
		At this point, ModeShape passes virtually all of the JCR Technology Compatibility Kit (TCK) tests,
		except for a few known issues with ModeShape as well as bugs in the TCK tests. As soon as these
		are fixed, we'll start the process of attaining JCR 2.0 certification for ModeShape.
	</para>
	<para>
		What's next for ModeShape? 
		We also plan to add support for clustering multiple ModeShape engines spread across multiple JVM processes.
		And each expect to introduce more 
		<link linkend="repository-connectors">connectors</link> and <link linkend="sequencers">sequencers</link> to our library.
		Other items on our <ulink url="&Roadmap;">roadmap</ulink> include a JDBC driver for ModeShape, 
		a web user interface, Seam integration, and integration with even more kinds of
		information systems and repositories.

    We're always looking for suggestions and contributors.  If you'd like to get involved on ModeShape, the first
		step is joining the <ulink url="&Home;lists.html">mailing lists</ulink> or hopping into our chat room
		on IRC (at irc.freenode.net#jbossmodeshape).  You can also <ulink url="&Home;subversion.html">download the code</ulink>
		and get it building, and start looking for simple issues or bugs in our
    <ulink url="&JIRA;">JIRA issue management system</ulink>.
  </para>
	<para>
		But if nothing else, please contact us and let us know how you're using ModeShape and what we can do to make it even better.
	</para>
	<para>
		And, if you haven't already, check out our &GettingStarted; guide, which has examples that you can build and run to see
		ModeShape in action.
