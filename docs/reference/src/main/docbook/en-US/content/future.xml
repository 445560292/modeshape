	<para>
		ModeShape &versionNumber; provides a very capable JCR implementation with powerful and unique features not matched
		by other implementations.  This release adds several key features, such as JCR versioning and a JCR connector,
		and includes fixes and improvements. 
	</para>
	<para>
		At this point, ModeShape passes all of the JCR Technology Compatibility Kit (TCK) tests 
		for Level 1, Level 2, and the optional locking and versioning features (plus almost all of the tests for the
		optional observation feature). We'll soon begin the process of attaining JCR certification for ModeShape.
	</para>
	<para>
		What's next for ModeShape? 
		We also plan to add support for clustering multiple ModeShape engines spread across multiple JVM processes.
		And each expect to introduce more 
		<link linkend="repository-connectors">connectors</link> and <link linkend="sequencers">sequencers</link> to our library.
		Other items on our <ulink url="&Roadmap;">roadmap</ulink> include a JDBC driver for ModeShape, 
		a web user interface, Seam integration, and integration with even more kinds of
		information systems and repositories.

    We're always looking for suggestions and contributors.  If you'd like to get involved on ModeShape, the first
		step is joining the <ulink url="&Home;lists.html">mailing lists</ulink> or hopping into our chat room
		on IRC (at irc.freenode.net#jbossmodeshape).  You can also <ulink url="&Home;subversion.html">download the code</ulink>
		and get it building, and start looking for simple issues or bugs in our
    <ulink url="&JIRA;">JIRA issue management system</ulink>.
  </para>
	<para>
		But if nothing else, please contact us and let us know how you're using ModeShape and what we can do to make it even better.
