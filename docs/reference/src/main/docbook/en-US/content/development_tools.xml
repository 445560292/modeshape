  <title>Developer tools</title>
  <para>
		The JBoss DNA project uses <link linkend="maven">Maven</link> as its primary build tool, <link linkend="svn">Subversion</link>
		for its source code repository, <link linkend="jira">JIRA</link> for the issue management and bug tracking system,
		and <link linkend="hudson">Hudson</link> for the continuous integration system.  We do not stipulate a specific integrated
		development environment (IDE), although most of us use <link linkend="eclipse">Eclipse</link> and rely upon the code formatting
		and compile preferences to ensure no warnings or errors.
  </para>
	<para>
		The rest of this chapter talks in more detail about these different tools and how to set them up.
	</para>
	<sect1 id="jdk">
		<title>JDK</title>
		<para>
			Currently, JBoss DNA is developed and built using <ulink url="http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index_jdk5.jsp">JDK 5</ulink>,
			so if you're a contributor, you should have that installed and should use it before committing any changes.  Note that you
			should be able to use the <ulink url="http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp">latest JDK</ulink> (which is currently
			JDK 6). 
		</para>
		<para>
			Why do we build using JDK 5 and not 6? The main reason is that if we were to use JDK 6, then JBoss DNA couldn't really be used in any
			applications or projects that still used JDK 5.  Plus, anybody using JDK 6 can still use JBoss DNA.
			However, considering that the end-of-life for Java 5 is 
			<ulink url="http://java.sun.com/products/archive/eol.policy.html">October 2009</ulink>, we may be switching to 
			Java 6 in the coming months.
		</para>
		<para>
			When installing, simply follow the procedure for your particular platform.  On most platforms, this should set the
			<code>JAVA_HOME</code> environment variable.  But if you run into any problems, first check that this environment
			variable was set to the correct location, and then check that you're running the version you expect by running
			the following command:
		</para>
		<programlisting role="XML"><![CDATA[ java -version ]]></programlisting>
		<para>
			If you don't see the correct version, double-check your installation.
		</para>

	<sect1 id="svn">
		<title>Subversion</title>
		<para>JBoss DNA uses Subversion as its source code management system, and specifically the instance at 
			<ulink url="http://www.jboss.org">JBoss.org</ulink>.  Although you can view the
			<ulink url="&Subversion;trunk/">trunk</ulink> of the Subversion repository
			(or using <ulink url="&Fisheye;trunk">FishEye</ulink>) through your browser,
			it order to get more than just a few files of the latest version of the source code, you probably want
		 	to have an SVN client installed.  Several IDE's have SVN support included (or available as plugins),
			but having the command-line SVN client is recommended.  See 
			<ulink url="http://subversion.tigris.org/">http://subversion.tigris.org/</ulink> for downloads and instructions for your
			particular platform.

	<sect1 id="maven">
		<title>Maven</title>
		<para>JBoss DNA uses Maven 2 for its build system, as is this example. Using Maven 2 has several advantages, including
	    the ability to manage dependencies. If a library is needed, Maven automatically finds and downloads that library, plus
	    everything that library needs. This means that it's very easy to build the examples - or even create a maven project that
	    depends on the JBoss DNA JARs.</para>
		<para>
      To use Maven with JBoss DNA, you'll need to have <link linkend="jdk">JDK 5 or 6</link> and Maven 2.0.9 (or higher).</para>
		<para>
      Maven can be downloaded from <ulink url="http://maven.apache.org/">http://maven.apache.org/</ulink>, and is installed by unzipping the
      <code>maven-2.0.7-bin.zip</code> file to a convenient location on your local disk. Simply add <code>$MAVEN_HOME/bin</code>
      to your path and add the following profile to your <code>~/.m2/settings.xml</code> file:

			There are just a few commands that are useful for building JBoss DNA (and it's <link linkend="modules">subprojects</link>).

			<title>Building releases</title>
			<para>
				The process of building JBoss DNA releases involves running a Maven build with some extra parameters.
				Building these artifacts, including all documentation and JavaDocs, does take extra time, which is why
				they are not included in the default parameters.

			<para>
				To build the release, issue the following command while in the <code>target/</code> directory:
			</para>
			<programlisting>mvn -P assembly clean javadoc:javadoc install</programlisting>

				This command runs "clean", "javadoc:javadoc", and "install" goals using the "assembly" profile, 
				which adds the production JavaDocs, the Getting Started document, the Reference Guide document, 
				the Getting Started examples, and several ZIP archives.  The order of the goals is important,
				since the "install" goal attempts to include the JavaDoc in the archives.
