  <title>Teiid text extractor</title>
  <para>
   	The &TeiidVdbTextExtractor; class is an implementation of &TextExtractor; that extracts 
    from Teiid virtual database (i.e., ".vdb") files the virtual database's logical name, description, and 
	  version, plus the logical name, description, source	name, source translator name, and JNDI name for each of the 
	  virtual database's models.

		This sequencer is not enabled by default, but it's very easy to add this text extractor to the ModeShape
		configuration. To do so in a configuration file, simply add the following fragment under the
		"&lt;mode:textExtractors>" element (which should be immediately under the "&lt;configuration>" root element):

		Then, make sure the <code>modeshape-sequencer-teiid.jar</code> file on the classpath or, if you're using
		Maven, your application has a dependency on the <code>org.modeshape:modeshape-sequencer-teiid</code>
		library.
