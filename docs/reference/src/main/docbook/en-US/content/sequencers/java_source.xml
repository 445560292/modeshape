  <title>Java Source File Sequencer</title>
    <para>
		One of the sequencers that included in ModeShape is the <emphasis role="strong">modeshape-sequencer-java</emphasis> subproject.
		This sequencer parses Java source code added to the repository and extracts the basic structure of the classes and enumerations 
		defined in the code.
		This structure includes: the package structures, class declarations, class and member attribute declarations,
		class and member method declarations with signature (but not implementation logic), enumerations with each enumeration literal value,
		annotations, and JavaDoc information for all of the above. 
		After extracting this information from the source code, the sequencer then writes this structure into the repository,
		where it can be further processed, analyzed, searched, navigated, or referenced.
	</para>
	<para>
		As noted previously, the &JavaMetadataSequencer; class provides a pair of JavaBean properties that can be used to specify 
		a custom &SourceFileRecorder; 
		implementation to use to map the extracted metadata to an output location:

						Optional property that, if set, provides an instance of the &SourceFileRecorder; interface that will be used for all

					<entry>
						Optional property that, if set, provides the name of a class that provides a custom implementation of the &SourceFileRecorder; interface.  
						This class must have a no-argument, public constructor.  If set, an instance of this class will be created immediately and reused for all
						subsequent sequencing activity for this sequencer.  If this property is set to null, a default implementation will be used.  The default

	<para>
		The default &SourceFileRecorder; generates output that is compatible with previous versions of the &JavaMetadataSequencer;.  To generated 
		sequenced output that is identical to the output generated by the &ClassFileSequencer;, set the <code>sourceFileRecorderClassName</code>
		property to &quot;org.modeshape.sequencer.java.ClassSourceFileRecorder&quot;.

		To use this sequencer, simply include the <code>modeshape-sequencer-java</code> JAR (plus all of the JARs that it is dependent upon)
		in your application and configure the &JcrConfiguration; to use this sequencer using something similar to:
