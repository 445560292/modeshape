  <title>DDL File Sequencer</title>
    <para>
        The DDL file sequencer is included in JBoss DNA and is capable of parsing the more important DDL statements from several 
        different dialects, and constructing a graph structure that is largely the same for all dialects (though some dialects will 
        result in dialect-specific properties and maybe nodes). The sequencer attempts to detect the dialect by running multiple 
        parsers and finding the one with the "best fit".</para>
    <para>
        One very interesting capability of this sequencer is that, although only a subset of the (more common) DDL statements 
        are supported, the sequencer is still extremely functional since it does still add all statements into the output graph, 
        just without much detail other than just the statement text and the position in the DDL file. Thus, if a DDL file 
        contains statements the sequencer understands and statements that the sequencer does not understand, the graph will 
        still contain all statements and those statements understood by the sequencer will have their full detail. 
        Since the underlying parsers are able to operate upon a single statement, it is possible to go back later 
        (after the parsers have been enhanced to support additional DDL statements) and re-parse only those incomplete statements 
        in the graph.
    </para>
    <para>
        Initially the following ddl dialects are included with this sequencer: Oracle, Derby, Postgres and MySql.</para>
    <para>
        Each specific dialect extends a basic parser framework implementing the SQL 92 spec and includes
        <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
                <para>Detailed parsing of CREATE SCHEMA, CREATE TABLE and ALTER TABLE.</para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para>Partial parsing of DROP statements</para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para>General parsing of remaining schema definition statements (i.e. CREATE VIEW, CREATE DOMAIN, etc.</para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para>Does NOT perform detailed parsing of SQL (i.e. SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, etc....) statements.</para>
            </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
    </para>
    <sect1>
        <title>Example</title>
	    <para>Sequencing results in graph nodes basically representing the BNF structure of each DDL statement. Below is an example DDL
	        schema definition statement containing table and view definition statements.
	    </para>
	    <programlisting>
CREATE SCHEMA hollywood
	  CREATE TABLE films (title varchar(255), release date, producerName varchar(255))
	  CREATE VIEW winners AS SELECT title, release FROM films WHERE producerName IS NOT NULL;
	    </programlisting>
	    <para>The resulting graph structure, shown below contains the raw statement expression, pertinent table, column and key
	        reference information as well as critical integer position values (line number, column number and character index) to
	        tie the statement back to the original DDL file.
	    </para>
