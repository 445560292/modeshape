  <title>Subversion Connector</title>
  <para>
		This connector provides read-only access to the directories and folders within a Subversion repository, providing that content in
		the form of <code>nt:file</code> and <code>nt:folder</code> nodes.
		This source considers a workspace name to be the path to the directory on the repository's root directory location
		that represents the root of that workspace (e.g., "trunk" or "branches"). 
		New workspaces can be created, as long as the names represent valid existing directories within the SVN repository.
  </para>
	<para>
		The &SVNRepositorySource; class provides a number of JavaBean properties that control its behavior:

				<row>
					<entry>name</entry>
					<entry>The name of the repository source, which is used by the &RepositoryService; when obtaining a &RepositoryConnection; by name.</entry>
				</row>
				<row>
					<entry>repositoryRootURL</entry>
					<entry>
						Required property that should be set with the URL to the Subversion repository.
					</entry>
				</row>
				<row>
					<entry>username</entry>
					<entry>
						The username that should be used to establish a connection to the repository.
					</entry>
				</row>
				<row>
					<entry>password</entry>
					<entry>
						The password that should be used to establish a connection to the repository.  This is not required if the URL represents an
						anonymous SVN repository address.
					</entry>
				</row>
				<row>
					<entry>directoryForDefaultWorkspace</entry>
					<entry>Optional property that, if used, specifies the relative path of the directory in the repository that should be
						exposed as the default workspace.
						Each workspace name is the URL of the portion of the SVN repository being exposed (e.g., "http://acme.com/repo/trunk").
					</entry>
				</row>
				<row>
					<entry>predefinedWorkspaceNames</entry>
					<entry>Optional property that, if used, defines names of the workspaces that are predefined and need not be created before being used.
						Each workspace name is the URL of the portion of the SVN repository being exposed (e.g., "http://acme.com/repo/trunk").
						This can be coupled with a "fase" value for the "creatingWorkspaceAllowed" property to allow only the use of only predefined workspaces.
					</entry>
				</row>
				<row>
					<entry>creatingWorkspaceAllowed</entry>
					<entry>Optional property that defines whether clients can create additional workspaces.  The default value is "true".
					</entry>
				</row>
				<row>
					<entry>retryLimit</entry>
					<entry>Optional property that, if used, defines the number of times that any single operation on a &RepositoryConnection; to this source should be retried
						following a communication failure. The default value is '0'.</entry>
				</row>
				<row>
					<entry>cacheTimeToLiveInMilliseconds</entry>
					<entry>Optional property that, if used, defines the maximum time in milliseconds that any information returned by this connector
						is allowed to be cached before being considered invalid.  When not used, this source will not define a specific
						duration for caching information.</entry>

	<para>
		Using the SVN connector can be used by creating in the &JcrConfiguration; a repository source that uses the &SVNRepositorySource; class.
		For example:
