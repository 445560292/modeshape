  <title>Infinispan Connector</title>
  <para>
  	The Infinispan repository connector allows a <ulink url="http://www.jboss.org/infinispan/">Infinispan</ulink> instance to be 
		used as a JBoss DNA (and thus JCR) repository.  This provides a repository that is an effective, scalable, and distributed cache,
		and is often paired with other repository sources to provide a local or <link linkend="federation-connector">federated</link>
		repository.
  </para>
	<para>
		The &InfinispanSource; class provides a number of JavaBean properties that control its behavior:

				<row>
					<entry>cacheManagerJndiName</entry>
					<entry>Optional property that, if used, specifies the name in JNDI where an existing Infinispan Cache Manager instance can be found.
						That factory would then be used if needed to create an Infinispan Cache instance.  If no value is provided, then the

					<entry>Optional property that, if used, defines the default for how long this information provided by this source may to be
