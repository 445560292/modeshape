  <title>JBoss Cache Connector</title>
  <para>
  	The JBoss Cache repository connector allows a <ulink url="http://www.jboss.org/jbosscache/">JBoss Cache</ulink> instance to be 
		used as a JBoss DNA (and thus JCR) repository.  This provides a repository that is an effective, scalable, and distributed cache,
		and is often paired with other repository sources to provide a local or <link linkend="federation-connector">federated</link>
		repository.
  </para>
	<para>
		The &JBossCacheSource; class provides a number of JavaBean properties that control its behavior:

				<row>
					<entry>name</entry>
					<entry>The name of the repository source, which is used by the &RepositoryService; when obtaining a &RepositoryConnection; by name.</entry>
				</row>
				<row>
					<entry>cacheFactoryJndiName</entry>
					<entry>Optional property that, if used, specifies the name in JNDI where an existing JBoss Cache Factory instance can be found.
						That factory would then be used if needed to create a JBoss Cache instance.  If no value is provided, then the
						JBoss Cache <code>DefaultCacheFactory</code> class is used.</entry>
				</row>
				<row>
					<entry>cacheConfigurationName</entry>
					<entry>Optional property that, if used, specifies the name of the configuration that is supplied to the cache factory
						when creating a new JBoss Cache instance.</entry>
				</row>
				<row>
					<entry>cacheJndiName</entry>
					<entry>Optional property that, if used, specifies the name in JNDI where an existing JBoss Cache instance can be found.
						This should be used if your application already has a cache that is used, or if you need to configure the cache in
						a special way.</entry>
				</row>
				<row>
					<entry>uuidPropertyName</entry>
					<entry>Optional property that, if used, defines the property that should be used to find the UUID value for each node

				</row>
				<row>
					<entry>retryLimit</entry>
					<entry>Optional property that, if used, defines the number of times that any single operation on a &RepositoryConnection; to this source should be retried
						following a communication failure. The default value is '0'.</entry>
				</row>
				<row>
					<entry>defaultCachePolicy</entry>
					<entry>Optional property that, if used, defines the default for how long this information provided by this source may to be 
						cached by other, higher-level components.  The default value of null implies that this source does not define a specific
						duration for caching information provided by this repository source.</entry>
				</row>
				<row>
					<entry>nameOfDefaultWorkspace</entry>
					<entry>Optional property that is initialized to an empty string and which defines the name for the workspace that will be used by default
						if none is specified.</entry>

					<entry>predefinedWorkspaceNames</entry>
					<entry>Optional property that defines the names of the workspaces that exist and that are available for use without having to create them.</entry>
