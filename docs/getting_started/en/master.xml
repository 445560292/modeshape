    <title>What this book covers</title>
    <para>The goal of this book is to help you learn about JBoss DNA and how you can use it in your own applications to get the
      most out of your JCR repositories.</para>
    <para>The part of the book starts out with an introduction to content repositories and an overview of the JCR API, both of which are an
    important aspect of JBoss DNA.  This is followed by an overview of the the JBoss DNA project, it's architecture, and a basic
    roadmap for what's coming next.</para>
    <para>The next part of the book covers how to download and build the examples, how to use JBoss DNA with
    existing repositories, and how to build and use custom sequencers.

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <para>There are a lot of choices for how applications can store information persistently so that it can be accessed at a
      later time and by other processes. The challenge developers face is to use an approach that most closes matches the needs of
      their application. This choice is more important as developers choose to focus their efforts on the application-specific
      logic, delegating much of the responsibilities for persistence to libraries and frameworks.</para>
    <para>
      Perhaps one of the easiest techniques is to simply store information in
      <emphasis>files</emphasis>
      . The Java language makes working with files relatively easy, but Java really doesn't provide many bells and whistles. So
      using files is an easy choice when the information is either not complicated (for example property files), or when users may
      need to read or change the information outside of the application (for example log files or configuration files). But using
      files to persist information becomes more difficult as the information becomes more complex, as the volume of it increases,
      or if it needs to be accessed by multiple processes. For these situations, other techniques are often a better choice.
    </para>
    <para>
      Another technique built into the Java language is
      <emphasis>Java serialization</emphasis>
      , which is capable of persisting the state of an object graph so that it can be read back in at a later time. However, Java
      serialization can quickly become tricky if the classes are changed, and so its beneficial usually when the information is
      persisted for a very short period of time. For example, serialization is sometimes used to send an object graph from one
      process to another.
    </para>
    <para>
      One of the more popular persistence technologies is the
      <emphasis>relational database</emphasis>
      . Relational database management systems have been around for decades and are very capable. The Java Database Connectivity
      (JDBC) API provides a standard interface for connecting to and interacting with relational databases. However, it is a
      low-level API that requires a lot of code to use correctly, and it still doesn't abstract away the DBMS-specific SQL
      grammar. Also, working with relational data in an object-oriented language can feel somewhat unnatural, so many developers
      map this data to classes that fit much more cleanly into their application. The problem is that manually creating this
      mapping layer requires a lot of repetitive and non-trivial JDBC code.
    </para>
    <para>
      <emphasis>Object-relational mapping</emphasis>
      libraries automate the creation of this mapping layer and result in far less code that is much more maintainable with often
      as good (if not better) performance than handwritten JDBC code. The new
      <ulink url="http://java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/J2EE/jpa/">Java Persistence API (JPA)</ulink>
      provide a standard mechanism for defining the mappings (through annotations) and working with these entity objects. Several
      commercial and open-source libraries implement JPA, and some even offer additional capabilities and features that go beyond
      JPA. For example,
      <ulink url="http://www.hibernate.org">Hibernate</ulink>
      is one of the most feature-rich JPA implementations and offers object caching, statement caching, extra association
      mappings, and other features that help to improve performance and usefulness.
    </para>
    <para>
      While relational databases and JPA are solutions that work for many applications, they become more limited in cases when the
      information structure is highly flexible, is not known a priori, or is subject to frequent change and customization. In
      these situations,
      <emphasis>content repositories</emphasis>
      may offer a better choice for persistence. Content repositories are almost a hybrid between relational databases and file
      systems, and typically provide other capabilies as well, including versioning, indexing, search, access control,
      transactions, and observation. Because of this, content repositories are used by content management systems (CMS), document
      management systems (DMS), and other applications that manage electronic files (e.g., documents, images, multi-media, web
      content, etc.) and metadata associated with them (e.g., author, date, status, security information, etc.). The
      <ulink url="http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=170">Content Repository for Java technology API</ulink>
      provides a standard Java API for working with content repositories. Abbreviated "JCR", this API was developed as part of the
      Java Community Process under
      <ulink url="http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=170">JSR-170</ulink>
      and is being revised under
      <ulink url="http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=283">JSR-283</ulink>
      .
    </para>
    <para>
      The
      <emphasis>JBoss DNA project</emphasis>
      is building the tooles and services that surround content repositories. Nearly all of these capabilities are to be hidden
      below the JCR API and involve automated processing of the information in the repository. Thus, JBoss DNA can add value to
      existing repository implementations. For example, JCR repositories offer the ability to upload files into the repository and
      have the file content index for search purposes. JBoss DNA defines a library for also sequencing that content to extract
      meaningful information and store it in the repository, where it can then be searched, accessed and analyzed using the JCR
      API.
    </para>
    <para> JBoss DNA is building other features as well. One goal of JBoss DNA is to create federated repositories that
      dynamically merge the information from multiple databases, services, applications, and other JCR repositories. Another is to
      create customized views based upon the type of data and the role of the user that is accessing the data. And yet another is
      to create a REST-ful API to allow the JCR content to be accessed easily by other applications written in other languages.
    </para>
    <para>
      The
      <link linkend="jboss_dna">next chapter</link>

      what's coming in future releases.

      then provides instructions for downloading and compiling the sequencer examples for the current release.
      <link linkend="using_dna">Chapter 4</link>

      <title>Sequencers</title>
      <para> The current JBoss DNA release contains a sequencing framework that is designed to sequence data (typically files)
        stored in a JCR repository to automatically extract meaningful and useful information. This additional information is then
        saved back into the repository, where it can be accessed and used.</para>
      <para> In other words, you can just upload various kinds of files into a JCR repository, and DNA automatically processes
        those files to extract meaningful structured information. For example, load DDL files into the repository, and let
        sequencers extract the structure and metadata for the database schema. Load Hibernate configuration files into the
        repository, and let sequencers extract the schema and mapping information. Load Java source into the repository, and let
        sequencers extract the class structure, JavaDoc, annotations. Load a PNG, JPEG, or other image into the repository, and
        let sequencers extract the metadata from the image and save it in the repository. The same with XSDs, WSDL, WS policies,
        UML, MetaMatrix models, etc.</para>
      <para>
        JBoss DNA sequencers sit on top of existing JCR repositories (including federated repositories) - it basically extracts
        more useful information from what's already stored in the repository. And it uses the existing JCR versioning system. Each
        sequencer typically processes a single kind of file format. The following sequencer is included in JBoss DNA:
        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>
              Image sequencer - A sequencer that processes the binary content of an image file, extracts the metadata for the
              image, and then writes that image metadata to the repository. Gets the file format, image resolution, number of bits
              per pixel and optionally number of images, comments and physical resolution from JPEG, GIF, BMP, PCX, PNG, IFF, RAS,
              PBM, PGM, PPM and PSD files. (This sequencer may be improved in the future to also extract EXIF metadata from JPEG
              files; see
              <ulink url="http://jira.jboss.org/jira/browse/DNA-26">DNA-26</ulink>

      <title>Federation</title>
      <para>There is a lot of information stored in many of different places: databases, repositories, SCM systems,
        registries, file systems, services, etc. The purpose of the federation engine is to allow applications to use the JCR API
        to access that information as if it were all stored in a single JCR repository, but to really leave the information where
        it is.</para>
      <para>Why not just move the information into a JCR repository? Most likely there are existing applications that rely upon
        that information being where it is. If we were to move it, then all those applications would break. Or they'd have to be
        changed to use JCR. If the information is being used, the most practical thing is to leave it where it is.</para>
      <para>
        Then why not just copy the information into a JCR repository? Actually, there are times when it's perfectly reasonable to
        make a copy of the data. Perhaps the system managing the existing information cannot handle the additional load of more
        clients. Or, perhaps the information doesn't change, or it does change and we want snapshots that don't change. But more
        likely, the data
        <emphasis>does</emphasis>
        change. So if applications are to use the most current information and we make copies of the data, we have to keep the
        copies synchronized with the master. That's generally a lot of work.
      </para>
      <para>The JBoss DNA federation engine lets us leave the information where it is, yet lets client applications use the JCR
        API to access all the information without caring where the information really exists. If the underlying information
        changes, client applications using JCR observation will be notified of the changes. If a JBoss DNA federated repository is
        configured to allow updates, client applications can change the information in the repository and JBoss DNA will propagate
        those changes down to the original source.</para>
      <sect2>
        <title>Connectors</title>
        <para>
          The JBoss DNA federation engine will use connectors to interact with different information sources to get at the content
          in those systems. Some ideas for connectors include:
          <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>

          If the connectors allow the information they contribute to be updated, they must provide an
          <code>XAResource</code>
          implementation that can be used with a Java Transaction Service. Connectors that provide read-only access need not
          provide an implementation.

        <title>Sources</title>
        <para>
          Each JBoss DNA federated repository is configured to federate and integrate information from one or more
          <emphasis>sources</emphasis>
          . Each source contains the configuration details (e.g., connection information, location, properties, options, etc.) for
          working with that particular source, as well as a reference to the connector that should be used to establish
          connections to the source. And of course, sources can be added or removed without having to stop and restart the
          federated repository.

      </sect2>
      <sect2>
        <title>Building the unified graph</title>
        <para> The federation engine works by effectively building up a single graph by querying each source and merging or
          unifying the responses. This information is cached, which improves performance, reduces the number of (potentially
          expensive) remote calls, reduces the load on the sources, and helps mitigate problems with source availability. As
          clients interact with the repository, this cache is consulted first. When the requested portion of the graph (or
          "subgraph") is contained completely in the cache, it is retuned immediately. However, if any part of the requested
          subgraph is not in the cache, each source is consulted for their contributions to that subgraph, and any results are
          cached.</para>
        <para> This basic flow makes it possible for the federated repository to build up a local cache of the integrated graph
          (or at least the portions that are used by clients). In fact, the federated repository caches information in a manner
          that is similar to that of the Domain Name System (DNS). As sources are consulted for their contributions, the source
          also specifies whether it is the authoritative source for this information (some sources that are themselves federated
          may not be the information's authority), whether the information may be modified, the time-to-live (TTL) value (the time
          after which the cached information should be refreshed), and the expiration time (the time after which the cached
          information is no longer valid). In effect, the source has complete control over how the information it contributes is
          cached and used.</para>
        <para>
          The federated repository also needs to incorporate
          <emphasis>negative caching</emphasis>
          , which is storage of the knowledge that something does not exist. Sources can be configured to contribute information
          only below certain paths (e.g.,
          <code>/A/B/C</code>
          ), and the federation engine can take advantage of this by never consulting that source for contributions to information
          on other paths. However, below that path, any negative responses must also be cached (with appropriate TTL and expiry
          parameters) to prevent the exclusion of that source (in case the source has information to contribute at a later time)
          or the frequent checking with the source.
        </para>
      </sect2>
      <sect2>
        <title>Queries</title>
        <para> The JBoss DNA federated repository will also support queries against the integrated and unified graph. In some
          situations the query can be determined to apply to a single source, but in most situations the query must be planned
          (and possibly rewritten) such that it can be pushed down to all the appropriate sources. Also, the cached results must
          be consulted prior to returning the query results, as the results from one source might have contributions from another
          source.</para>
        <para> It is hoped that the MetaMatrix query engine can be used for this purpose, after it is open sourced. This engine
          implements sophisticated query planning and optimization techniques for working efficiently with multiple sources.
        </para>

      <sect2>
        <title>Updates</title>
        <para>
          The JBoss DNA federated repositories also make it possible for client applications to make changes to the unified graph
          within the context of distributed transactions. According to the JCR API, client applications use the Java Transaction
          API (JTA) to control the boundaries of their transactions. Meanwhile, the federated repository uses a
          <ulink url="http://www.jboss.org/jbosstm/">distributed transaction service</ulink>
          to coordinate the XA resources provided by the connectors.
        </para>
        <para> It is quite possible that clients add properties to nodes in the unified graph, and that this information cannot be
          handled by the same underlying source that contributed to the node. In this case, the federated repository can be
          configured with a fallback source that will be used used to store this "extra" information.</para>
        <para>
          It is a goal that non-XA sources (i.e., sources that use connectors without XA resources) can participate in distributed
          transactions through the use of
          <emphasis>compensating transactions</emphasis>
          . Because the JBoss DNA federation engine implements the JCR observation system, it is capable of recording all of the
          changes made to the distributed graph (and those changes sent to each updatable source). Therefore, if a non-XA source
          is involved in a distributed transaction that must be rolled back, any changes made to non-XA sources can be undone. (Of
          course, this does not make the underlying source transactional: non-transactional sources still may expose the interim
          changes to other clients.)
        </para>
      </sect2>
      <sect2>
        <title>Events</title>
        <para> The JCR API supports observing a repository to receive notifications of additions, changes and deletions of nodes
          and properties. The JBoss DNA federated repository will support this API through two primary means.</para>
        <para> When the changes are made through the federated repository, the JBoss DNA federation engine is well aware of the
          set of changes that have been (or are being) made to the unified graph. These events are directly propagated to
          listeners.</para>
        <para> Sources have the ability to publish events, making it possible for the JBoss DNA federation engine and clients that
          have registered listeners to be notified of changes in the information managed by that source. These events are first
          processed by the federation engine and possibly altered based upon contributions from other sources. (The federation
          engine also uses these events to update or purge information in the cache, which may add to the event set.) The
          resulting (and possibly altered) event set is then sent to all client listeners.</para>

    <title>Downloading the examples</title>
    <para>JBoss DNA is built using Maven 2, so it's much easier to following along with the examples in this document if you
      install and configure Maven. Once this is done, you can very easily build the examples or even create a maven project that
      depends on the JBoss DNA JARs. Maven will automatically download the right versions of the JARs, including those other
      libraries on which JBoss DNA depends. Maven also makes it very easy to create an assembly of your final application so that
      you can package into a distributable form.</para>
    <para>
      The examples created for this User Guide use Maven2 to achieve exactly this so it is highly recommended that you
      <ulink url="http://labs.jboss.com/file-access/default/members/jbossmc/downloads/userGuide-examples-13112007.zip">download</ulink>
      these first and take a look at how they work.
    </para>
    <note>
      <para>
        To build and run the examples you first need to install and configure Maven 2.0.7 available from
        <ulink url="http://maven.apache.org/">http://maven.apache.org/</ulink>
      </para>
      <para>Installation is performed by downloading and unzipping the maven-2.0.7-bin.zip file to a convenient
        location on your local disk. Configuration consists of adding $MAVEN_HOME/bin to your path and adding the following
        profile to your ~/.m2/settings.xml file:</para>

  There are a lot of components on our roadmap, including federating
  
  </para>
      <para> Roadmap: We'll start on the federation engine as soon as 0.1 is out. The 0.1 release will contain the sequencing
      system, and while there will be one sequencer, we hope the community will help build the ones they need. Serge has started
      on a Java sequencer, and MetaMatrix is starting on a sequencer for MetaMatrix models. Check out JIRA for the list of the
      ones we've thought of.</para>
    <para> Your need for a web UI is very typical, which is why we also want to create a web interface (and RESTful service) that
      presents data using "domain-specific" views - that is, views that are specific to the type of data and user role. For
      example, if a user is viewing database information, the views should be structured to show all the information for a table
      and its columns, keys, and indexes. (This is in contrast with a "generic" node-based view where there is one page that shows
      the table and only links to the other columns, keys, etc. See http://www.jcr-explorer.org/screenshots.html for an example of
      a "generic" web UI.)</para>
